By: Luis Castejón Lozano and Pablo Bielza López-Manterola
This project aims to try several architectures on the Kaggle Face Keypoints Dataset.

**************************
The data preparation and the EDA is performed before the training.
Several architectures are tested:
- VGG-16
- ResNet50 (with and without transfer learning)
- Autoencoder
- Vision Transformer
